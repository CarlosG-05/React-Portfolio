                                I am a first-generation college student pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering with a concentration in Electronic Circuits and Systems at the University of California, San Diego. My passion for engineering stems from a lifelong fascination with how technology shapes the world around us. I am eager to apply my skills to develop innovative solutions that have a positive impact on society. Currently, I am seeking a summer internship to gain hands-on experience, deepen my understanding of real-world engineering practices, and continue growing both technically and professionally.
